# splicing
Splicing analysis with SplAdder.

The scripts `spladder-build.sh` and `spladder-test.sh` follow the [standard SplAdder workflow](https://spladder.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html) and were run on a SLURM cluster. The commands in `dump_spladder_splicing_graph.py` were executed to recover SplAdder's splicing graph. Subsequent analyses were performed with the scripts `spladder_quantif_Fig6D_TableS12.R` and `novel_exons_from_splicing_graph.R` to generate Figure 6D, table S12 and table S13.
